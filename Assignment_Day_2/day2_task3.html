        <h1>Dihydrogen Monoxide</h1>
        <p>
            <b>Dihydrogen monoxide</b>, also known as <i>hydroxyl acid or DHMO1</i>, is a dangerous substance that<sup>2</sup> : <br>
            is the major component of acid rain, <br>
            contributes to the greenhouse effect,<br> 
            may cause severe burns, is fatal if inhaled,<br>
            contributes to the erosion of our natural landscape,<br>
            accelerates corrosion and rusting of many metals, <br>
            may cause electrical failures and decreased effectiveness of automobile brakes, and <br>
            has been found in excised tumors of terminal cancer patients. <br><br>
            
            Despite the danger, DHMO is often used: <br>
            as an industrial solvent and coolant,<br>
            in nuclear power plants <br>
            in the production of Styrofoam<sup>TM</sup>,<br>
            as a fire retardant,<br>
            in many forms of cruel animal research, <br>
            as an additive in certain junk-foods and other food products, <br>
            in the distribution of pesticides. <br><br>
            Even after washing, produce remains contaminated by this chemical <br><br>
            <sub>1</sub>The more common chemical formula is H<sub>2</sub>O. <br><br>
