                    “Dihydrogen Monoxide Dihydrogen monoxide, also known as hydroxyl acid or DHMO1, is a
                    dangerous substance that2: is the major component of acid rain, contributes to the greenhouse
                    effect, may cause severe burns, is fatal if inhaled, contributes to the erosion of our natural
                    landscape, accelerates corrosion and rusting of many metals, may cause electrical failures and
                    decreased effectiveness of automobile brakes, and has been found in excised tumors of
                    terminal cancer patients. Despite the danger, DHMO is often used: as an industrial solvent and
                    coolant, in nuclear power plants in the production of StyrofoamTM, as a fire retardant, in many
                    forms of cruel animal research, as an additive in certain junk-foods and other food products, in
                    the distribution of pesticides. Even after washing, produce remains contaminated by this
                    chemical. 1The more common chemical formula is H2O. 2Source: Coalition to Ban Dihydrogen
